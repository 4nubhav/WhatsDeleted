Messages & media are saved to a backup location so that you can access them even if the sender deletes them.

How it works:

• Notification Listener logs new messages.
• Media Observer watches for new images.
	
How to use:

• Allow storage access.
• Allow notification access (tap on the switch next to Notification Listener and follow the instructions).
• Media Observer is turned on by default.
	
Backup Location:

• Images -> External Storage/WhatsDeleted/WhatsDeleted Images/
	
Points to note:

• Messages received directly in the chat window (and not in the notifications) won't be saved.
• Images will be saved to the backup directory only if they were downloaded.
• Clear the message log & image directory periodically to save storage space.
